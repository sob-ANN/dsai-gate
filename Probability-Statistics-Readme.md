## <a name="course"></a>NPTEL and MOOCs Courses

Course to deepen your knowledge of Probability and Statistics:

- **[Probability for Computer Science, IIT Kanpur](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106104233)**
   by Prof. Nitin Saxena IIT K,This is a crash course to introduce the concept of probability formally; and exhibit its applications in computer science, combinatorics, and algorithms. **Excellent Assignments with MCQs**
  
- **[Stat110 (Probability)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo)**
   taught at Harvard University by Joe Blitzstein: Lecture videos, review materials, and over 250 practice problems with detailed solutions are provided. This course is an introduction to probability as a language and set of tools for understanding statistics, science, risk, and randomness.

- **[Statistics and Probability | Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)**
The course looks vast, but upon deeper inspection, it seems like a mashup of undergraduate probability, including random variables and statistics. The probability portion is very similar to the engineering mathematics syllabus of the gate; the statistics part is a bit of addition that needs to be studied and contains primarily hypothesis testing.

- **[Electrical - Probability Foundation for Electrical Engineers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbMVogVj5nJQqGHrpAloTec_lOKsG-foc)**
Probability Foundation for Electrical Engineers by Dr. Krishna Jagannathan,Department of Electrical Engineering,IIT Madras.

- **[MIT RES.6-012 Introduction to Probability, Spring 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP60hI9ATjSFgLZpbNJ7myAg6)**
 Instructor: John Tsitsiklis, Patrick Jaillet; The tools of probability theory, and of the related field of statistical inference, are the keys for being able to analyze and make sense of data. These tools underlie important advances in many fields, from the basic sciences to engineering and management.

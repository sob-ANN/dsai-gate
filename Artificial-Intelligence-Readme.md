## <a name="course"></a>NPTEL and MOOCs Courses
The Recommended NPTEL-Based Courses for Artificial Intelligence

**[An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, IIT Delhi](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106102220)**
by Professor Mausam. The Course given covers almost everything. However, the course contents may be out of order. For example, CSP is in module 5, yet it isn't represented in the syllabus, but module 6 is in the syllabus, according to Gate. The Assignments are uploaded to the site linked above under the downloads tab and can be attempted. The course is one of the best courses in India in machine learning.

**[Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence, IIT Guwahti](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwdnzlV3ogoXaceHrrFVZCJKbm_laSHcH)**
The course is visibly more structured and a good course that can be used to prepare for the GATE Topics in Data Science and AI. The course even goes beyond the mere AI Topics that are in the syllabus, for example it touches on machine learning topics too
